This may look like MockFS Version 0.1.6, but it really isn't.  The following
changes were made by Joyent, so you can't just drop in a new version of MockFS
and expect it to work.

* Fixed a bug where files open with 'w' mode that do not use the block style
  were not created in the mock file system

* Fix a bug in dir.glob

* Added transactional support
  * Added a clone method to MockDir

* Added support for a number of FileUtils and File methods that Joyent uses which
  MockFS originally did not support:

  * FileUtils.mkdir_p
... (FINISH THIS LIST) ...
