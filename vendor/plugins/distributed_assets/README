DistributedAssets
=================

This simple plugin allows for simple distributed assets (images, javascripts,
and stylesheets) across a variety of hosts. It was heavily inspired and
re-uses code from Ezra Zygmuntowicz[1].

While in standard Rails you can do

  # config/environments/production.rb
  config.action_controller.asset_host = "http://assets.domain.com"

and have your assets served from assets.domain.com instead of your
application's main server, DistributedAssets will give you the ability to use

  # config/environments/production.rb
  config.action_controller.asset_host = %w(
    http://assets1.domain.com
    http://assets2.domain.com
    http://assets3.domain.com
    http://assets4.domain.com
  )

and have your assets served from 4 asset servers in a distributed manner.

This doesn't necessarily mean that these asset servers need to be separate
machines or even separate processes on the same machine. Since browsers tend
to only open 2 concurrent connections[2] to any given hostname, you're
effectively spreading the load by simply making a single webserver available
under a variety of (virtual) hostnames.

DistributedAssets will make sure that every asset will be served from the
exact hostname every single time so that browser caching works well with your
asset URLs. It will also completely transparently hook into any of the Rails
asset tag helpers, since it patches
ActionView::Helpers::AssetTagHelper#compute_public_path. Therefore no changes
to your code are required to make use of the newly acquired distributed
goodness.
