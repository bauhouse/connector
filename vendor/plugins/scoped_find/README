ScopedFind
==========

Adds a :scope option to AR::Base.find, which automatically limits to:
 - the current organization
 - what the current user can see
 - what the current user can modify in the way specified by the scope

Examples:
  Person.find(4, :scope => :read)
  mailbox.messages.find(:all, :scope => :delete)
