This plugin uses GetText Ruby gem by Masaoh Mutoh
- http://www.yotabanana.com/hiki/ruby-gettext.html - 
to localize Rails applications.

The plugin includes the option to localize Date and Moth names and abbreviations.

Just call Date.translate_strings once you've set the user locale.
 
(It also includes a customized  version of 
ActionView::Helpers::DateHelper::distance_of_time_in_words). 

Sample tasks useful to generate application po/mo files are included, 

In order to get more info about GetText Gem Usage, you should give a
look to Masaoh's documents for developers at 
http://www.yotabanana.com/hiki/ruby-gettext-dev.html, specially the
