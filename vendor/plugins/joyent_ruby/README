JoyentRuby
==========

This plugin includes Joyent specific extensions to the Ruby core.  Think long
and hard before you add something here.  Ruby is dynamic and powerful and it
can be very cool to add shortcuts, but muddying the waters can harm 
maintainability and "learnability".  If you do add something, be sure to add
tests!
