So, we've got a new mime renderer.  It's written in C so I'll give you instructions on setting it up locally.  It's relatively painless on OSX.

It has two requirements:
* glib2
* gmime

glib2 is in dports, so you can just 'port install glib2' if you haven't already.  gmime is in dports, but it's a very old version.  You may try to use that, but I make no guarantees about it working.

It's best to install gmime by hand.  Grab the source tarball from: http://spruce.sourceforge.net/gmime/sources/v2.2/gmime-2.2.6.tar.gz

Standard configure, make, make install:

$ tar zxvf gmime-2.2.6.tar.gz
$ cd gmime-2.2.6/
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

That'll shove gmime into /usr/local

Now, from your connector checkout run 'rake joyent:gmime' and it should build the mime parser and you can be on your way.
